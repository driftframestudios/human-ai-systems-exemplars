# LIMS/ELN Program Specification

This repository is the intent and comparison control plane for the LIMS/ELN
open-receipt collaboration. It publishes versioned requirements, executable
examples, decision forecasts, acceptance contracts, and the lock coordinates
used to compare the active implementation with the simulated final state.

The current planned program release is `spec-v0.3.1`. It consumes the canonical
governance release `governance-v2.0.1`, Control Plane Profile 0.3.0, and schema
`2.0.1`; its release
and governance commit coordinates receive observed
commit and tree identities during promotion.

The repository describes what collaborators can verify. The simulation supplies
an executable future reality whose assumptions, synthetic decisions, and
evidence mode remain visible and revisable. A complete simulated closure can
therefore stand as a first-class result while a separately represented observed
closure remains available for future running-system evidence.

## Constellation

| Repository | Authority |
|---|---|
| [`lims-eln-program-specification`](./) | Intent, examples, risks, forecasts, and acceptance criteria |
| [`lims-eln-enterprise-implementation`](../lims-eln-enterprise-implementation/) | Active code, infrastructure, migrations, and observed execution manifests |
| [`lims-eln-simulated-final-state`](../lims-eln-simulated-final-state/) | Executable counterfactual and simulated phase artifacts |
| [`lims-eln-comparative-evidence`](../lims-eln-comparative-evidence/) | Paired execution, normalization, adjudication, and redacted evidence |
| [`site-reading-governance`](../site-reading-governance/) | Shared schemas, language posture, workflows, templates, and rulesets |

The repository-local
[`LIMS/ELN enterprise reference pack`](../../lims-eln-enterprise-reference-v0.1/README.md)
is the provenance-bearing seed. New releases preserve its reviewed source role,
content identities, and lineage while exact private review coordinates remain in
their authorized source record.

## Working model

1. A specification release freezes rules, scenarios, forecasts, and fixtures.
2. The simulated final state resolves each open design question through an
   assumption-bearing decision record.
3. The active implementation evolves independently against the same contract.
4. The comparator pins exact releases and emits an adjudicated difference
   report.
5. Collaborators classify each difference as convergence, beneficial
   divergence, an implementation gap, a simulation correction, a context
   change, or an evidence question.
6. New evidence creates a new forecast release while the earlier forecast
   remains available for calibration.

## Coordination Horizon

[`coordination-horizon.json`](coordination-horizon.json) is the flexible
coordination surface for active, queued, and exploratory work. It records
entry evidence, exit evidence, dependencies, and re-entry instructions. Its
authority is coordination-only; released contracts, runtime policy, and
accountable domain roles continue to govern effects and acceptance.

[`machine-node.json`](machine-node.json),
[`first-receipt.json`](first-receipt.json), and the Coordination Horizon are
strict projections of governance schema release `2.0.1`. Contract references
carry SHA-256 digests that the program validator recalculates. The Machine Node
orients; the first receipt supplies safe re-entry; neither grants production or
domain authority.

## Practitioner Probes

[`probes/catalog.json`](probes/catalog.json) contains ten LIMS/ELN Practitioner
Probes. Each probe progresses through:

1. observable surface;
2. mechanism;
3. realistic scientific use;
4. edges and maintenance;
5. review, repair, evidence, and accountable handoff.

Each probe declares a technical-veracity status and links requirements, rules,
scenarios, and receipts. This makes principal-level claims inspectable rather
than relying on prose confidence alone.

## Shared Python contract nucleus

[`src/lims_eln_contracts`](src/lims_eln_contracts) publishes the small runtime
contract shared by implementation, simulation, and comparison work. It gives
each repository the same vocabulary for:

- evidence mode and assurance stage;
- strict specimen commands;
- bounded operations, requests, effect summaries, and receipts;
- comparative observation envelopes; and
- the executable golden-specimen journey.

The package owns wire meaning and canonical digests. Each consuming service
continues to own authenticated identity, authorization, domain behavior,
persistence, and accountable decisions. This keeps agency calibrated to the
role that can exercise it.

The released resources travel inside the package:

- [`operations.v1.json`](src/lims_eln_contracts/resources/operations.v1.json)
  carries the three versioned operation definitions;
- [`golden-specimen.v1.json`](src/lims_eln_contracts/resources/scenarios/golden-specimen.v1.json)
  carries one synthetic, executable specimen journey; and
- [`resources/schemas`](src/lims_eln_contracts/resources/schemas) carries six
  generated JSON Schema projections for non-Python consumers.

Pydantic strengthens these external boundaries through strict types, declared
fields, finite numbers, and immutable model instances. The JSON parser also
rejects duplicate keys and non-finite numeric tokens; callers can proceed by
supplying one value per key and a finite measurement or explicit textual state.

Install the package from this repository and load the released resources:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

```python
from lims_eln_contracts import (
    load_golden_specimen_scenario,
    load_operation_catalog,
)

catalog = load_operation_catalog()
scenario = load_golden_specimen_scenario()
```

The generated schemas remain a byte-identical projection of the Python models.
After a deliberate model revision, render them once; routine validation checks
that the committed projection remains current.

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/generate_contract_schemas.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/generate_contract_schemas.py --check
```

## Bounded callers

[`specifications/bounded-caller.json`](specifications/bounded-caller.json)
defines one service-owned contract for humans, workloads, workflows, and
task-scoped AI callers. The service derives identity from authenticated
context, validates strict inputs, enforces tenant and resource scope, applies
budgets, rechecks effect preconditions, and emits an attributable receipt.

The specification-by-example suite covers:

- one authorized read;
- one narrow idempotent metadata correction;
- one approval-gated migration cutover.

An AI caller selects released operations through an allowlist. It gains no
independent Scientific, Quality, Regulatory, Security, Operations, or business
authority. Consequential approvals bind operation version, canonical request
digest, tenant, effect ceiling, intended use, expiry, and recovery coordinates.
The outer request and released payload carry one approval receipt identity,
keeping the reviewed payload and execution grant joined at the service boundary.

## Database modernization contracts

[`database/primitive-findings.json`](database/primitive-findings.json) records
32 critical or high cross-repository findings with stable identities,
source locations, material effects, affirmative target states, and correction
bindings. [`plans/database-modernization-plans.json`](plans/database-modernization-plans.json)
compares five routes against one declared probability event and synthesizes a
seven-stage chain with a recalibration interstitial after every stage. The
reference and implementation probability tables are bounded local derivatives;
the canonical program estimates remain the cross-route comparison surface.

[`database/constellation-finding-index.json`](database/constellation-finding-index.json)
binds all 115 intentionally overlapping program, reference, and implementation
finding records to immutable source commits, raw ledger digests, record identities,
counts, and each exact probability event's relationship to the canonical event.

[`specifications/data-primitives.json`](specifications/data-primitives.json)
defines canonical temporal, identifier, digest, measurement, unit, vocabulary,
JSON, nullability, tenancy, event, idempotency, evidence, and access-path
semantics. [`specifications/database-migration.json`](specifications/database-migration.json)
defines a tool-neutral PostgreSQL schema-migration capability contract, the
selected Flyway Community 13.0.0 profile, four ownership boundaries, nine
reconciliation dimensions, seven release gates, and a retained-test
verification matrix. Flyway owns ordering, checksummed history, coordination,
and status. Program SQL owns PostgreSQL domain semantics; vendor-supported
lifecycle paths, cross-vendor reconciliation, and accountable release evidence
retain their separate owners.

[`receipts/database-open-receipts.json`](receipts/database-open-receipts.json)
preserves eight future-observed proof obligations. The digest-bound
[`release/database-release-manifest.json`](release/database-release-manifest.json)
joins those obligations to the contract artifacts and specification-by-example
suite while implementation coordinates remain explicitly pending. See
[`docs/DATABASE_MODERNIZATION.md`](docs/DATABASE_MODERNIZATION.md) for the
probability posture, evidence boundaries, synthesized chain, and interstitials.
The [`database constellation ledger`](docs/DATABASE_CONSTELLATION_LEDGER.md)
interprets that machine index and connects it to the governance, reference,
implementation, simulation, and comparison proof surfaces.

## Evidence ladder

`specified → simulated → locally_verified → configured_environment_qualified
→ representative_rehearsal_completed → intended_use_validated
→ accountably_accepted`

Each stage states its own evidence mode. A simulated future reality may
exercise and close the full shape of any stage with synthetic environments,
measurements, and role-bound decisions. That result remains
`evidence_mode: simulated`. The program design carries
`authority: advisory_design_only`; an executed canonical closure can be
definitive inside its named selected future reality while retaining
`production_authorization_effect: none`. Its separately tracked observed
successor begins open and can advance later through environment-bound evidence
and accountable human decisions.

## Simulated closure of the four substantive receipt classes

[`simulations/future-reality-closure-v0.3.json`](simulations/future-reality-closure-v0.3.json)
is the advisory program design for a coherent 2028 future and fully specifies:

- configured Sapio, Benchling, and LabKey environments;
- representative migration, rollback, clean restore, continuity, and data exit;
- production-bound security, privacy, AWS configuration and secret lifecycle,
  observability, support, and incident operation;
- distinct Scientific, Quality, and Regulatory acceptance.

All nine underlying receipt records point to one of these four class-level
closures. Every record preserves both `closed_in_future_reality` for the
simulated branch and `open` for its future observed branch.

[`simulations/simulated-receipt-closure.v2.json`](simulations/simulated-receipt-closure.v2.json)
is the exact canonical closure emitted by the executable simulation under its
historical governance 2.0.0 record schema and validated by governance 2.0.1.
Its identity is `FUTURE-REALITY-LIMS-2028-001`, and its canonical
JSON digest is
`sha256:c402e7a72d9066424d5b83c8fda51ca2fad43c025d017a5f5535126239c96ffb`.
It contains exactly four receipt families, declares `closed_in_simulation`,
preserves the environment-observed branch as `separate_unasserted_state`, and
grants zero production-authorization effect. The advisory design uses the
distinct identity `FUTURE-REALITY-DESIGN-LIMS-2028-001`; one identity therefore
denotes one modeled reality and authority posture.

[`simulations/future-reality-2028-06-30-v1.json`](simulations/future-reality-2028-06-30-v1.json)
is the byte-identical canonical bundle shared with the simulation and
comparison surfaces. It binds reference result digest
`sha256:9d42b972c77764c81ff32fefe8f02367a27406e9ba082a704587cc9b5a9da860`
and aggregate artifact digest
`sha256:2d8e67ec2da8236fc23de7943e7727d2b74e0e6ee2b15afd9c765443b9c52b61`.

[`specifications/receipt-vocabulary-map.v1.json`](specifications/receipt-vocabulary-map.v1.json)
version-controls the mapping from individual governance receipt families to
program proof classes and grouped canonical closure families. It also makes
the `closed_in_future_reality` → `closed_in_simulation` and observed
`open` → `separate_unasserted_state` transitions explicit.

## Validation

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_program.py
python3 scripts/check_language.py
python3 scripts/check_language.py --format sarif
python3 scripts/scan_secret_shapes.py
PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/generate_contract_schemas.py --check
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The program validator uses the Python standard library and checks stable identifiers,
cross-file references, bounded operation classes, probe levels and veracity,
forecast coordinates, simulated and observed receipt-state separation,
Coordination Horizon structure, Machine Node posture, receipt ownership, and
required collaboration surfaces. Database validation additionally closes the
finding-to-policy map, plan and interstitial shape, contract references, open
receipt set, and manifest digests. Its JSON boundary requires unique object
keys and finite numbers before identifiers or canonical digests enter
validation. The shared contract tests use Pydantic at the external model
boundary and verify strict parsing, semantic invariants, packaged resources,
and byte-identical JSON Schema regeneration.

Candidate records carry explicit zero coordinates and an open promotion receipt.
Released records carry pinned coordinates and a closed, evidence-bearing
promotion receipt. The validator exercises both lifecycle shapes, so settlement
can advance without weakening the candidate boundary.

Release changes and consumer migration notes are recorded in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
[`docs/migrations/0.3.0-to-0.3.1.md`](docs/migrations/0.3.0-to-0.3.1.md).

## Runtime configuration and protected values

AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store carries environment-scoped non-secret
configuration. AWS Secrets Manager carries vendor credentials and other secret
material under the approved KMS key. Workload identities receive the narrow
read actions and resource paths required by their environment. Rotation,
version-stage handling, bounded caches, CloudTrail evidence, and redacted
retrieval telemetry form one testable lifecycle.

Repositories, build artifacts, Terraform state, logs, fixtures, and telemetry
carry governed references or redacted metadata. The open receipt
`RCP-SECR-001` advances after production-bound retrieval, rotation, policy, KMS,
cache, audit, and secret-shape probes complete accountable review.

## Language posture

Guidance names desired states, stable invariants, and verifiable outcomes.
Hard safety and privacy boundaries pair the boundary with the state that
replaces it. Code comments use `TARGET`, `GUARD`, and `CONTRAST` where the
distinction materially assists future collaborators.

[`docs/AUTHOR_FEEDBACK.md`](docs/AUTHOR_FEEDBACK.md) defines the advisory,
structure-aware Vale scope, rule severity, and checksum-verified tool
coordinate. The deterministic program gate retains candidate authority.

That gate projects `language-policy-v1.0.0` across authored Markdown, JSON,
YAML, and Python surfaces. It emits stable text, JSON, or SARIF findings and
qualifies behavior against a versioned golden corpus. Exact exemptions carry
accountable ownership, review/expiry coordinates, and a
rule–path–fingerprint binding. See
[`docs/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md`](docs/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md) for the complete contract
and its bounded authority.

The [language-policy operating contract](docs/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md) carries the
applied Semantic Attractor Design guidance and its bounded authority.
